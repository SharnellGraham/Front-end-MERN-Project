# CalorieTrakr - Frontend

This is the front-end for our CalorieTrakr App, developed using React, Axios, and date-fns. Check out the back-end repo [HERE](https://github.com/JpadillaCoding/calorie-MERN-project-back)

## Description

The CalorieTrakr App was designed to be a simple and effective calorie-tracking app that allows users to track their daily food intake and monitor their progress toward their fitness goals.

## Features

The CalorieTrakr app provides the following features:

- Search for a specific food item by name using the "SEARCH" function. The matching foods will be displayed, and you can select one to view its nutrition facts.
- Delete a previously selected food item using the "DELETE" function.
- View the nutrition facts for the selected food item per serving.
- Track your daily food intake using a meal tracking table that contains four meal types - breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks - each with their respective calorie, carbohydrate, fat, protein, sodium, and sugar values.
- Click the "Add Food" link in each row to open a popup window that allows you to search for and select a food item, which updates the corresponding nutrient values for the selected meal.
- The table calculates and displays the total nutrient values for all meals combined.
- The table is responsive and adjusts its layout for mobile and desktop screens.

## Challenges Faced

Challenges to building the front-end were largely due to data movement, using of state, and saving to the database. The Diary gave us the most challenges as it had multiple moving parts and was all the technicality of the main page with its search, with the added functionality of having to input the data into a table and tie it to another collection. Authentication was also a challenge, but we were able to overcome it with the help of a third-party library.
